# About Me
I'm a master student at University of Toronto. My current research focuses on Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, especially their intersection. I enjoy traveling and doing the research around the world. I have spent time at Naver (Seongnam, South Korea), Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, US), and Academia Sinica (Taipei, Taiwan). 

I will start my internship at Amazon Alexa as an applied scientist intern in Aachen Germany on May 2020. Here's my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=89kHyuEAAAAJ#) and my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Sgv5t1A8Vsbhuwy5xmwyFOmWjO8iOm86).
